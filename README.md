# Mai Dung - Data Analysis Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my data analyst portfolio. I'm MD, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

Within this collection of projects, you'll discover my passion for data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, and effective data presentation. These are just a few of the skills I've honed along my data journey. The majority of my projects leverage SQL, PowerBI, and Excel to uncover insights and tell data-driven stories. In this README, I'll provide a concise overview of my background and aspirations in data science, as well as a glimpse into my future projects.

## About & Data Journey
With a Bachelor of Business degree in Marketing from Western Sydney University, my journey into the world of data analysis started with a deep appreciation for understanding consumer behavior and market trends. I quickly realized the power of data in uncovering patterns, predicting outcomes, and driving strategic decision-making. This fascination led me to pursue roles where I could combine my marketing expertise with analytical skills, ultimately carving a path toward becoming a data-driven professional.

As a self-learner, I've embarked on a path to develop and enhance my data skills, building upon my foundation in marketing. My goal is to continue learning in the field of data and, in turn, make a positive impact on decision-making through data-driven insights.

The projects you'll find below showcase my ability to not only analyze data but also to present it in a clear, visually appealing manner, ensuring decision-makers can easily grasp the insights and take meaningful action. They represent my dedication to learning, my passion for data, and my commitment to making a difference through the power of information.
